# FundamentalsofBusinessAnalytics
# All the code files that are seen in this repository were created during my Fundamentals of Business Analytics class in Fall of 2020. 
# I was able to analyze a dataset of my choice after learning introductory commands, thus I chose to work with basketball data for the National Basketball
# Association. I investigated whether a player's performance throughout the season was worthy of their salary.
